        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>

        <p>1. My name is Clara Kim and I am a junior majoring in Design with a concentration in Communication and have a second major in Biology.</p>

        <p>2. I have mostly worked with 2D designs using the Adobe Suite without much of the interactive elements. I wanted to learn more about how I can use HTML/CSS to develop a more interactive design and expand my possibilites in design.</p>

        <p>3. I do not have extensive experience with HTML/CSS/JS, but I have tried using HTML once in a Typography class. </p>

        <p>4. I hope to become more comfortable using the coding language to be able to create a well-designed, creative website.</p>

        <p>5. The maximized interactability and audience experience is an important factor that hugely distinguishes designing for screen from designing for paper.</p>
