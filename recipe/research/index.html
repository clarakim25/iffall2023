    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
    <div class="inst">
    <p><strong>1.</strong> Add pumpkin puree, butter, sugar, water, and salt into a large pot.</p>
    <p><strong>2.</strong> On medium-low heat, bring to a simmer, and make sure the butter has melted completely.</p>
    <p><strong>3.</strong> Sift the flour into the mix. Stir well until there are no dry spots and the dough becomes cohesive. This process should take around five minutes.</p>
    <p><strong>4.</strong> Transfer the dough into a mixing bowl with the paddle attachment. Work the dough on low setting until the steam evaporates to cool down the dough.</p>
    <p><strong>5.</strong> Once the dough has come to room temperature, add the eggs one by one until the dough emulsifies. It's best to crack the eggs in a separate bowl to ensure no egg shells are in the dough!</p>
    <p><strong>6.</strong> Once all the eggs have been incorporated, the dough should look silky smooth, slightly runny, and cohesive.</p>
    <p><strong>7.</strong> Transfer the mix into a piping bag with a star tip.</p>
    <p><strong>8.</strong> Have a pot set up with neutral frying oil. The oil temperature should be around 180 Celsius or 356 Fahrenheit.</p>
    <p><strong>9.</strong> To pipe: start from the center of the pot in a circular motion, creating a whirlpool shape. Don't worry about the strands touching; it won't stick since it's frying in oil.</p>
    <p><strong>10.</strong> To achieve the swirled churro shape, use a pair of chopsticks and swirl from the center, twisting the churro tighter.</p>
    <p><strong>11.</strong> Flip around after 2-3 minutes, so both sides are golden brown and crispy.</p>
    <p><strong>12.</strong> Once finished, transfer the churro to a wired rack. Let the excess oil drip off, and while the churros are hot, add to the pumpkin-spiced sugar mix.</p>
    <p><strong>13.</strong> Enjoy!</p>

It lays out the necessary information (ingredients and instructions) first and then includes the secondary information, establishing good hierarchy.</p>

    <p>This website has a very simple, concise, and well-flowing layout with all the necessary information one might need when reading a recipe.

    <p>This website keeps a limited color palette and a repeated use of the same logo to illustrate their brand image clearly and aesthetically. Looking at references like this website has informed me on how I should establish a cohesive color palette to effectively convey the visual mood of the page. The layout of the images using a grid is well structured.</p>
    <p><a href="https://howmanyplants.com/">How Many Plants</a></p>
    <p>This website is very effective in creating its theme through the use of illustrations that utilize a same illustration style and similar color palette. The cursor changing when the viewer interacts with the plants is also interesting and enhances the user experience. This serves as a good example on how digital illustrations can be seamlessly incorporated in websites, and also how it sets up the visual tone and continues it among every aspect of the website.</p>
